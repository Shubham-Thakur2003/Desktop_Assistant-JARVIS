# Desktop_Assistant-JARVIS
This JARVIS(Desktop Assistant) works same like Siri/ Google Assistant etc. But the JARVIS deals with the computer itself mainly. Currently it is Voice Sensitive as most of the people are not very good at speaking. You can interact with your laptop’s microphone/console. The response generated by the assistant will display on the console or as a speech via the speaker/User. I’d build this personal A.I. assistant using Python.
What can this A.I. assistant do for you?
• It can send emails on your behalf. • It can play music for you. • It can do Wikipedia searches for you. • It is capable of opening websites like Google, Facebook, etc., in a web browser.
• It is capable of opening your code editor or IDE with a single voice command.
 It can do a video search on Youtube.  It can do a google search for you.  It can tells you current date and time.  It is capable to show your IP address.
