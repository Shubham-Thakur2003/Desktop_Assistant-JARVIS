# Desktop_Assistant-JARVIS
This JARVIS(Desktop Assistant) works same like Siri/ Google Assistant etc. But the JARVIS deals with the computer itself mainly. Currently it is Voice Sensitive as most of the people are not very good at speaking. You can interact with your laptop’s microphone/console. The response generated by the assistant will display on the console or as a speech via the speaker/User. I’d build this personal A.I. assistant using Python.
